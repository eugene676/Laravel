If manually adding each JavaScript file to vite.config.js sounds tedious, don’t worry—I’ve got a solution for you. I’ve written a piece of code that automatically scans and includes all JavaScript and CSS files from the resources folder. This means you no longer need to manually specify each file in vite.config.js. The script dynamically locates and registers all your asset files, streamlining the process and saving you a ton of time, especially if you're working with a large project. You can simply drop new JS or CSS files into the resources folder, and they’ll automatically be picked up the next time you run your build command. You can find this code in the scripts section, and feel free to copy it into your project!
